# tic-tac-toe-design
A Tic-Tac-Toe responsive design challenge for a Live on YouTube - HTML&amp;CSS

I'm making this tic-tac-toe interface for a challenge from @ViorelMocanu. He'll review and give feedback on my work.

I'm going to use HTML and vanilla CSS styling. I'll also exercise my freshly aquired knowledge of CSS Grid and responsive layouts.

Watched an excellent tutorial from Kevin Powell on @font-face and using local fonts. I'm gonna use this in my project.

Managed to use Grid combined with Flexbox for maximum responsiveness and layout.
