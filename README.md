A Tic-Tac-Toe responsive design challenge for a Live on YouTube - HTML&amp;CSS

I'm making this tic-tac-toe interface for a challenge. Viorel is gonna evaluate it on his YT live and give us feedback.

I'm going to use HTML and vanilla CSS styling. I'll also exercise my freshly aquired knowledge of CSS Grid and responsive layouts.

Watched an excellent tutorial from Kevin Powell on @font-face and using local fonts. I'm gonna use this in my project.
